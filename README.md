# Encounter Simulator 5e (es5e)
This is a tool aimed at Dungeon Masters for D&D 5e, with the purpose of offering a method for estimating the difficulty
and length of a combat encounter, without having to rely on abstract (and often inconsistent) concepts such as Challenge
Rating for estimating the difficulty of a combat encounter.

Instead, this tool repeatedly simulates a fight between two groups, outputting statistics such as the probability of
survival for the player characters, the number of survivors, and more.

The tool is currently very much in an experimental state, and makes a great deal of simplifying assumptions that falsify
the results. Current work on this tool is primarily focused on removing as many of these simplifications as possible,
while still preserving computational efficiency.
